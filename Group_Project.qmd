## Data import

In the following three chunks of code we are reading the different csv files of our three datasets into different variables, respectively `drug_seizure`, `lethal_overdoses` and `education`.

```{r}
#| message: false
drug_seizure <- vroom(here("drug-consumption.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| message: false
lethal_overdoses <- vroom(here("lethal-overdoses.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| message: false
education <- vroom(here("education.csv"))
```

Just below, we implemented a first cleaning of the `education` variable, which we called `education_clean`. The goal was first to remove the empty columns, and renaming the remaining ones for clarity and usability.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
education <- vroom(here("education.csv"))

education_clean <- education %>%
  slice(8:(n() - 3))%>%  

select(-c(3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 
            27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43)) %>%

## Cleaning

### Education Data Set

The first steps of cleaning just below are done on the education data set. We realized that the name of the column variables were not properly aligned with their respective values compared to the initial data set in xlsx format. Thus, we had to change them. After that, we removed column 12 since this was not useful for our analysis, the latest was about people who did associate degrees. The second step of cleaning on the education dataset was to remove the column that concerns the year 2012 since our analysis is focused on the year 2022 only. Then, we had to fix the fact that our numeric columns are stored as characters, likely due to the use of commas as decimal or thousand separators.

```{r}
# Rename specific columns and remove column 12
education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  rename(
    # Specify new names for the columns
    `years25_atleast_highschool_2012` = 5,
    `years25_total_bachelor+_2012` = 6,
    `years25_bachelor_2012` = 7,
    `years25_graduate_2012` = 8,
    `years25_LessHighSchool_2022` = 9,
    `years25_atleast_highschool_2022` = 10,
    `years25_onlyhighschool_2022` = 11,
    `useless` = 12,
    `years25_total_bachelor+_2022` = 13,
    `years25_bachelor_2022` = 14,
    `years25_graduate_2022` = 15
  )

# Remove useless columns as well as columns on the year 2012
education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  select(-useless, -matches("2012"))

education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  # Remove everything after the comma (including the comma) and the periods
  mutate(across(-states, ~ gsub(",.*", "", .))) %>%  # Remove the comma and everything after it
  mutate(across(-states, ~ gsub("\\.", "", .))) %>%  # Remove the dots
  # Convert to numeric
  mutate(across(-states, ~ as.numeric(.)))


# Sample of the cleaned education data set
kable(
  head(education_clean, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

We changed the names of the states by their codes, still in the education data set and we got rid of the observation about other jurisdictions as we don't have any information available about these.

```{r}
state_name <- unique(education_clean$states) # Extraction of unique states' names

state_codes <- data.frame(
  state_name = state_name,
  state_code = c("USA", "AL", "AK", "AZ", "AR", "CA", "CO", "CT", "DE", "DC", "FL", 
                 "GA", "HI", "ID", "IL", "IN", "IA", "KS", "KY", "LA", "ME", "MD", 
                 "MA", "MI", "MN", "MS", "MO", "MT", "NE", "NV", "NH", "NJ", "NM", 
                 "NY", "NC", "ND", "OH", "OK", "OR", "PA", "RI", "SC", "SD", "TN", 
                 "TX", "UT", "VT", "VA", "WA", "WV", "WI", "WY", "OTHER JURISDICTIONS", "PR")
)

education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  left_join(state_codes, by = c("states" = "state_name")) %>%  # Jointure by states names
  mutate(states = state_code) %>%  # Replace names by the codes
  filter(states != "OTHER JURISDICTIONS") %>%  # Remove unwanted rows
  select(-state_code)

kable(
  head(education_clean, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)

```

### Drug Seizure Data Set

<br> In the following, we proceed to the cleaning of the data set about drug seizure that we've already imported. First, we kept only 2022 as this is the only year which we will focus our analysis on, thus we removed all other years.

```{r}
#| message: false
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  filter(FY == 2022)%>%
  rename(states = `Area of Responsibility`) 

kable(
  head(drug_seizure, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

Now, the goal is to change the values in the variable `states` of the drug seizures data set because here they are organized in offices.

```{r}
# Extract unique values from the 'states' column of the drug seizures data set
offices_ds <- unique(drug_seizure$states)

# Modifying the states values with the codes of the latest
ds_offices_codes <- data.frame(
  offices = offices_ds,
  codes = c(
    "GA", "MD", "IL", "TX", "CA", "FL", "LA", "NY", "INTL", "CA", "PR", "FL", 
    "MA", "NY", "MI", "WA", "OR", "TX", "TX", "CA", "AZ", "FL", "PR", "WA", "NY", 
    "MI", "ME", "WA", "VT", "TX", "TX", "CA", "TX", "TX", "TX", "CA", "AZ", "AZ", 
    "MT", "ND", "LA"
  )
)

# Column replacement
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  left_join(ds_offices_codes, by = c("states" = "offices")) %>%  # Joining by 'offices'
  mutate(states = ifelse(!is.na(codes), codes, states)) %>%
  select(-codes)

kable(
  head(drug_seizure, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

#### Figure 1: The number of seizures per drug in the USA.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Summary of the seizures by drug type
drug_summary <- drug_seizure %>%
  group_by(`Drug Type`) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Count = sum(`Count of Event`, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Creation of the graphic
drug_plot <- ggplot(drug_summary, aes(
  x = reorder(`Drug Type`, Total_Count),
  y = Total_Count,
  text = paste("Drug Type:", `Drug Type`, "<br>Count:", Total_Count)
)) +
  geom_col(fill = "darkorange", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of seizures per drug",
    x = "Type of drug",
    y = "Number of seizures"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(drug_plot, tooltip = "text")
```

#### Figure 2: Quantity seized per drug in the USA.

```{r}
# Summary of the seizures by drug type
drug_summary_2 <- drug_seizure %>%
  group_by(`Drug Type`) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Quantity = sum(`Sum Qty (lbs)`, na.rm = TRUE)  
  )

# Graph creation
drug_plot <- ggplot(drug_summary_2, aes(
  x = reorder(`Drug Type`, Total_Quantity),
  y = Total_Quantity,
  text = paste("Drug Type:", `Drug Type`, "<br>Total Quantity (lbs):", Total_Quantity)  # Text for the tooltip
)) +
  geom_col(fill = "darkorange", alpha = 0.8) + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Quantity of drugs seized per type (lbs)",
    x = "Type of drug",
    y = "Total quantity seized (lbs)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(drug_plot, tooltip = "text")
```

<br> These two graphs highlight the quantity and events of drugs seized per type in the USA, showcasing methamphetamine, khat, and marijuana as the most seized drugs. While fentanyl accounts for a smaller proportion of the total quantity seized, its public health impact is disproportionately high due to its potency and contribution to overdose deaths. <br> <br> <br> Continuing with the cleaning of the data set about drug seizure, we keep only the drug type "Fentanyl" as it is the core of our research focus:

```{r}
# Filter for only Fentanyl drug type
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  filter(`Drug Type` == "Fentanyl")

kable(
  head(drug_seizure, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

In the next chunk, we finish the cleaning of the data set about drug seizure, we first get rid of the columns that are useless for our analysis. The followings are the `Component` variable (which corresponds to the office in which the operations have been conducted), which we are not interested in, then, the `Region` variable as well as the `Land filter` variable. The last two are not important for our analysis because we won't focus on the differences inside each states but between each states and the variable `Region` gives information about the region of the offices, not of the states. Then, we perform data summarization by first aggregating the data by states, calculating the total number of events (Count of Event) and the total quantity of drugs seized (Sum Qty (lbs)) for each state.

```{r}
# Deleting useless variables (columns)
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  select(-Region, -`Land Filter`, -Component)

# Exclude the state "INTL" as it is not a state
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  filter(states != "INTL")

# Agregating data by states
drug_seizure_clean <- drug_seizure %>%
  group_by(states) %>%
  summarise(
    total_events = sum(`Count of Event`, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_quantity = sum(`Sum Qty (lbs)`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Print the result
kable(
  head(drug_seizure_clean, 3),
  col.names = c("State", "Total Events", "Total Quantity"),
  caption = "Summary of Fentanyl Seizures by State"
)
```

Right below, I add a new observation called "USA" where each numeric column represents the mean of all corresponding values across the other states, providing a national-level summary for total events and quantities. The rest opf the script calculates the proportion of total_events and total_quantity for each state relative to the USA total (the "USA" row represents 100%) and adds two new variables, total_events_proportion and total_quantity_proportion, to the dataset. These new variables express each state's contribution as a percentage of the overall total.

```{r}
# Add a USA row with the averages of the numeric columns
drug_seizure_clean <- drug_seizure_clean %>%
 filter(states != "USA") %>% # Remove the current USA row if it exists
  bind_rows(
    drug_seizure_clean %>%
      summarise(
        across(
          where(is.numeric), 
          ~ sum(.x, na.rm = TRUE) # Sum all numeric columns
        ),
        states = "USA" # Add the "USA" state name
      )
  )

# Adding the proportion variables
drug_seizure_clean <- drug_seizure_clean %>%
  mutate(
    total_events_proportion = round((total_events / total_events[states == "USA"]) * 100, 2),
    total_quantity_proportion = round((total_quantity / total_quantity[states == "USA"]) * 100, 2)
  )

kable(
  head(drug_seizure_clean, 3),
  caption = "Drug seizure dataset with an additional row for USA (mean values):",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

### Lethal overdoses Data Set

<br> Below is the cleaning of the lethal overdoses data set. First of all, we filter in order to keep only the year 2022. then, we remove the column URL, which we won't use for our analysis and finally, we change the code for "District of Columbia" with its code.

```{r}
#| message: false
lethal_overdoses_clean <- lethal_overdoses %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2022) %>%  # Keep only data for the year 2022
  rename(states = STATE) %>%  # Rename the 'STATE' column to 'states'
  select(-URL, -YEAR) %>%  # Remove the 'URL' column
  mutate(states = if_else(states == "District of Columbia", "DC", states))

kable(
  head(lethal_overdoses_clean, 3),
  caption = "Summary of the cleaned lethal overdoses data set read as a variable: ",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

Here, we are again adding a USA observation that calculate the mean across all the states of all the variables of the data set:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lethal_overdoses_clean <- lethal_overdoses_clean %>%
  bind_rows(
    lethal_overdoses_clean %>%
      summarise(
        across(
          .cols = where(is.numeric) & !c("DEATHS"),
          .fns = mean,
          na.rm = TRUE
        ),
        RATE = round(mean(RATE, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
        DEATHS = sum(DEATHS),
        states = "USA" # Add the observation `USA`
      )
  )
```

```{r}
kable(
  head(lethal_overdoses_clean, 3),
  caption = "Lethal Overdoses dataset with an additional row for USA (mean values):",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

<u>Notice that by zooming on each state, you can see the name of it and this will be the case on all the maps</u> <br>

-   **Comments:**

    This graphic show that states with low levels of education, specially those in the southern U.S. (for istance Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas), correspondz to regions with moderately high quantities of drugs seized. Conversely, some states with a high level of education, such as California, also show significant seizures.

    This may be explained by their high population density and more developed infrastructure for detecting and monitoring drug trafficking, irrespective of education levels. Finally, anomalies emerge in states such as Texas and Arizona, which record significant seizures despite education levels that do not stand out. This situation could reflect their strategic role as transit zones, notably due to their proximity to borders, facilitating drug trafficking.

-   **Hypothesis based on Graphics:**

    We may have a potential link between education levels and the drug situation in some regions. In areas where the level of education is relatively low, this could be associated with higher consumption behaviors or an increased prevalence of drug trafficking. However, this relationship isn't universal, and highly dependent on factors such as demographics and regional specificities.

    On the other hand, well-educated states such as California or New York, which record significant seizures, do not necessarily reflect high consumption. Rather, these seizures could be the result of effective surveillance systems and infrastructures capable of intercepting drug trafficking, further highlighting their strategic role in the fight against this phenomenon.

-   **Comments:**

    This map illustrates the quantity of drugs seized (in pounds) by state in the United States. The data show significant variations between states. California and Arizona record the highest quantities, exceeding 7,000 pounds respectively. On the other hand, several states, notably Alaska, show unavailable data or negligible quantities. The disparities observed may reflect factors such as the importance of drug trafficking routes, the proximity of borders and the priorities of law enforcement in each region. Due to this lack of some information, our analysis will focus on comparing drug seizure quantities across specific regions, including the northern, southern, eastern, and western borders of the United States. This approach allows us to identify regional patterns despite the missing data.

-   **Comments:**

    This graph shows overdose rates by state in 2022, with colors ranging from green (low rates) to red/purple (high rates). The highest rates are seen in states such as West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, often exceeding 70 overdoses per 100,000 inhabitants, while the lowest rates are found mainly in western states, such as South Dakota or Nebrasaka, with values below 20. This distribution highlights a marked regional disparity in the U.S. overdose crisis. <br>

## Joining

```{r}
# Perform the inner join on the three datasets using the 'states' variable
joined_dataset <- drug_seizure_clean %>%
  inner_join(education_clean, by = "states") %>%
  inner_join(lethal_overdoses_clean, by = "states")

# View the resulting dataset
kable(
  head(joined_dataset, 3), 
  caption = "Final dataset: Combined information from all three datasets (states in common only)", 
  escape = FALSE
)
```

<br> The joining process combines our three datasets (`drug_seizure_clean`, `education_clean`, and `lethal_overdoses_clean`) by using the common variable `states`. An **inner join** was performed, ensuring that only states present in all three datasets are included in the final combined dataset. This ensures consistency and avoids missing data issues for the analysis. <br>

The resulting dataset contains the following variables: <br> <br> - **states**: Abbreviations for each state. <br> - **total_events**: Total number of drug seizure events. <br> - **total_quantity**: Total quantity of drugs seized (in pounds). <br> - **total_events_proportion**: The proportion of drug seizure events for each state relative to the USA. <br> - **total_quantity_proportion**: The proportion of drug quantity seized for each state relative to the USA. <br> - Additional **education-related variables** (e.g., levels of education attainment by age groups) <br> -**RATE and DEATHS**: Provide information about the overdose death rate as well as the the number of deaths because of overdose, both per 100,000 inhabitants for each state. <br>

This merged dataset facilitates comprehensive cross-sectional analysis, integrating drug seizures, education levels, and overdose metrics for the states in common.<br>

## Reaserch Question

## Description of Data set:

## Descriptive Analysis

The script processes the `joined_dataset` variable by first renaming key variables to improve clarity: `total_events` becomes `total_seizure_events`, `total_quantity`becomes `total_quantity_seized`, `RATE` becomes `overdose_rate`, and `DEATHS` becomes `overdose_deaths`. Next, the observation corresponding to the USA is excluded, leaving only state-level data for analysis. <br> Once the data is filtered, we begin with an exhaustive descriptive analysis that includes all relevant statistical measures, enabling in-depth interpretation.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| cache: false

library(psych)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Detailed Table of the Descriptive Analysis (we eliminate character variable 'State)
numeric_dataset <- joined_dataset %>%
  select_if(is.numeric)  
summary_table <- describe(numeric_dataset) %>%
    mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(., 2))


# Improve the table for the Rendering
kable(summary_table, format = "html", align = "c", caption = "Descriptive Analysis of Variables") %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    full_width = TRUE, 
    font_size = 14
  ) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, width = "20em", background = "#f5f5f5") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#d3d3d3") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")

```

-   **Discussion**:

So, let's take a closer look at the statistical measure of the median. Here, the variables are classified according to their national median: <br> Education Variables: classified as "success" if their values are above the national median and "failure" otherwise. Overdose Variables: classified as "success" if their values are below the national median and "failure" otherwise. Drug Seizure Variables: classified as "success" if their values are below the national median and "failure" otherwise.

```{r}
# Rename variables
success_status_by_median <- joined_dataset %>%
  rename(
    total_seizure_events = total_events,
    total_quantity_seized = total_quantity,
    overdose_rate = RATE,
    overdose_deaths = DEATHS
  )

# Exclude USA observation and apply transformations
success_status_by_median <- success_status_by_median %>%
  filter(states != "USA") %>%  # Remove USA observation
  mutate(
    # Education variables: "success" if > median, otherwise "failure"
    across(contains("2022"), ~ ifelse(. > median(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure")),

    # Overdose variables: "success" if < median, otherwise "failure"
    across(matches("overdose_rate|overdose_deaths"), ~ ifelse(. < median(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure")),

    # Drug seizure variables: "success" if < median, otherwise "failure"
    across(starts_with("total"), ~ ifelse(. < median(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure"))
  )


kable(
  head(success_status_by_median, 3), 
  caption = " Classification of Success and Failure Based on Median for Education, Overdoses, and Drug Seizures Variables", 
  escape = FALSE
)

```

<br> This step of the descriptive analysis focuses on categorizing states into "success" and "failure" groups based on their performance relative to the **mean** for three key metrics: education, overdose rates, and drug seizures. The analysis begins by renaming variables for clarity, filtering out the USA observation to focus solely on state-level data, and applying transformations to classify each state. Education variables are labeled as "success" if they exceed the mean, while overdose and drug seizure variables are labeled as "success" if they fall below the mean. <br>

```{r}
# Rename variables
joined_dataset <- joined_dataset %>%
  rename(
    total_seizure_events = total_events,
    total_quantity_seized = total_quantity,
    overdose_rate = RATE,
    overdose_deaths = DEATHS
  )

# Exclude USA observation and apply transformations
success_status_by_mean <- joined_dataset %>%
  filter(states != "USA") %>%  # Remove USA observation
  mutate(
    # Education variables: "success" if > mean, otherwise "failure"
    across(contains("2022"), ~ ifelse(. > mean(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure")),

    # Overdose variables: "success" if < mean, otherwise "failure"
    across(matches("overdose_rate|overdose_deaths"), ~ ifelse(. < mean(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure")),

    # Drug seizure variables: "success" if < mean, otherwise "failure"
    across(starts_with("total"), ~ ifelse(. < mean(., na.rm = TRUE), "success", "failure"))
  )

kable(
  head(success_status_by_median, 3), 
  caption = " Classification of Success and Failure Based on Mean for Education, Overdoses, and Drug Seizures Variables", 
  escape = FALSE
)
```

The counts of "success" and "failure" are then summarized for each category.

```{r}
# Summarising success and failure counts
summary_success_status_by_mean <- success_status_by_mean %>%
  summarise(
    education_success = sum(across(contains("2022"), ~ . == "success"), na.rm = TRUE),
    education_failure = sum(across(contains("2022"), ~ . == "failure"), na.rm = TRUE),
    overdose_success = sum(across(matches("overdose_rate|overdose_deaths"), ~ . == "success"), na.rm = TRUE),
    overdose_failure = sum(across(matches("overdose_rate|overdose_deaths"), ~ . == "failure"), na.rm = TRUE),
    drug_seizure_success = sum(across(starts_with("total"), ~ . == "success"), na.rm = TRUE),
    drug_seizure_failure = sum(across(starts_with("total"), ~ . == "failure"), na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Finally, a proportional bar chart is created to visually represent the distribution of "success" and "failure" across the three metrics, using distinct colors for each status. This visualization highlights the relative performance of states within each category, providing an intuitive overview of the results.

```{r}
# Prepare data for plotting directly from summary_success_status
plot_data <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Education", "Education", "Overdose", "Overdose", "Drug Seizure", "Drug Seizure"),
  Status = c("Success", "Failure", "Success", "Failure", "Success", "Failure"),
  Count = c(
    summary_success_status_by_mean$education_success,
    summary_success_status_by_mean$education_failure,
    summary_success_status_by_mean$overdose_success,
    summary_success_status_by_mean$overdose_failure,
    summary_success_status_by_mean$drug_seizure_success,
    summary_success_status_by_mean$drug_seizure_failure
  )
)

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Category, y = Count, fill = Status)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill", width = 0.6) + # position = "fill" makes the bars proportional
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Success" = "steelblue", "Failure" = "tomato")) + # Custom colors
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Success and Failure by Category",
    x = "Category",
    y = "Proportion",
    fill = "Status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) # Show proportions as percentages
```

-   **Comments:**

    The high proportion of "success" in the Drug Seizure category suggests that most states have relatively low drug seizure quantities and events compared to the mean. This could indicate effective enforcement or that fentanyl distribution is not uniform across states. However, the correlation between drug seizures and overdoses needs further exploration—states with fewer seizures might still have high overdose rates due to the potency and availability of fentanyl.<br> <br> The Education category shows an almost equal distribution of "success" and "failure." This highlights significant variability in education levels across states, with some performing above the mean and others falling behind. For the research question, this variation in education levels could be crucial for understanding differences in overdose rates. States with higher education success may have populations better equipped to avoid risky behaviors or access preventive measures, potentially correlating with lower overdose rates.<br> <br> The Overdose category shows a higher proportion of "failure," indicating that many states have overdose rates or deaths exceeding the mean. This finding emphasizes that fentanyl overdoses remain a widespread problem, disproportionately affecting certain states. It suggests that efforts to mitigate overdoses need to focus on a majority of states where fentanyl use has escalated. <br> <br> The variability observed across education and overdose categories suggests a potential relationship between the two. States with high education failure (e.g., lower levels of high school or college attainment) might correspond to those with higher overdose failure, reflecting possible socioeconomic and educational disparities contributing to the fentanyl crisis. Conversely, states with education success might demonstrate better public health outcomes, including lower overdose rates. We will developp this later.

<br> We are now starting to examine the Relationship Between Education and Overdose Rates. (developp)

```{r, message = FALSE}
joined_dataset <- joined_dataset %>%
  filter(states != "USA")

ggplot(joined_dataset, aes(x = years25_graduate_2022, y = overdose_rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Graduate's Degree Number and Overdose Rates",
    x = "Number of graduate's Degree",
    y = "Overdose Rate (per 100,000)"
  )
```

-   **Comments:**

    This graph highlights that higher educational attainment (measured by graduate degrees) does not necessarily equate to lower fentanyl overdose rates. It implies that education, while important, may interact with other socioeconomic or regional factors to influence overdose rates.

```{r, message = FALSE}
joined_dataset <- joined_dataset %>%
  filter(states != "USA")

ggplot(joined_dataset, aes(x = years25_graduate_2022, y = overdose_deaths)) +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Graduate's Degree Number and Overdose Quantity",
    x = "Number of graduate's Degree",
    y = "Number of Overdose Deaths (per 100,000)"
  )
```

```{r, message = FALSE}

  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Bachelor's Degree Number and Overdose Rates",
    x = "Number of bachelor's Degree",
    y = "Overdose Rate (per 100,000)"
  )
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
joined_dataset <- joined_dataset %>%
  filter(states != "USA")

ggplot(joined_dataset, aes(x = years25_bachelor_2022, y = overdose_deaths)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Bachelor's Degree Number and Quantity of Overdose",
    x = "Number of bachelor's Degree",
    y = "Number of Overdose Deaths (per 100,000)"
  )
```

-   **Comments:**

    The red trendline shows a clear negative slope, indicating an inverse relationship between the number of bachelor's degrees and overdose deaths. States with higher numbers of bachelor's degrees tend to have fewer overdose deaths, suggesting that higher education levels may correlate with better health outcomes or reduced drug-related mortality.
