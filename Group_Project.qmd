## Data import

In the following three chunks of code we are reading the different csv files of our three datasets into different variables, respectively `drug_seizure`, `lethal_overdoses` and `education`.

```{r}
#| message: false
drug_seizure <- vroom(here("drug-consumption.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| message: false
lethal_overdoses <- vroom(here("lethal-overdoses.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| message: false
education <- vroom(here("education.csv"))
```

Just below, we implemented a first cleaning of the `education` variable, which we called `education_preclean`. The goal was first to remove the empty columns, and renaming the remaining ones for clarity and usability.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
education <- vroom(here("education.csv"))

education_clean <- education %>%
  slice(8:(n() - 3))%>%  

select(-c(3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 
            27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43)) %>%
rename(
  states = "Table 104.80. Percentage of persons 18 to 24 years old and age 25 and over. by educational attainment and state or jurisdiction: 2012 and 2022",

One of the main goals of the NCES is to support decision-making by providing data that policymakers, educators, and researchers can use to improve education. Its work includes collecting statistics on topics such as student enrollment, academic performance, school funding, and teacher employment. This information helps government officials and school leaders make informed choices about funding allocation, program development, and education reforms. By publishing detailed reports and datasets, the NCES allows educators and researchers to analyze trends, identify gaps, and evaluate the fairness and efficiency of school systems. Its data also sheds light on important issues like whether public school funding is being used effectively and whether all students have equal access to educational resources. Through its efforts, the NCES helps improve the quality of education and ensures that learning opportunities are fair and accessible for everyone.",

## Data cleaning

**The first steps of cleaning just below are done on the education data set**. We realized that the name of the column variables were not properly aligned with their respective values compared to the initial data set in xlsx format. Thus, we had to change them. After that, we removed column 12 since this was not useful for our analysis, the latest was about people who did associate degrees. The second step of cleaning on the education dataset was to remove the column that concerns the year 2012 since our analysis is focused on the year 2022 only.

```{r}
# Rename specific columns and remove column 12
education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  rename(
    # Specify new names for the columns
    `years25_atleast_highschool_2012` = 5,
    `years25_total_bachelor+_2012` = 6,
    `years25_bachelor_2012` = 7,
    `years25_graduate_2012` = 8,
    `years25_LessHighSchool_2022` = 9,
    `years25_atleast_highschool_2022` = 10,
    `years25_onlyhighschool_2022` = 11,
    `useless` = 12,
    `years25_total_bachelor+_2022` = 13,
    `years25_bachelor_2022` = 14,
    `years25_graduate_2022` = 15
  )

# Remove useless columns as well as columns on the year 2012
education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  select(-useless, -matches("2012"))

# Sample of the cleaned education data set
kable(
  head(education_clean, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

Changing the names of the states by their codes in the education dataset:

```{r}
state_name <- unique(education_clean$states) # Extraction of unique states' names

state_codes <- data.frame(
  state_name = state_name,
  state_code = c("USA", "AL", "AK", "AZ", "AR", "CA", "CO", "CT", "DE", "DC", "FL", 
                 "GA", "HI", "ID", "IL", "IN", "IA", "KS", "KY", "LA", "ME", "MD", 
                 "MA", "MI", "MN", "MS", "MO", "MT", "NE", "NV", "NH", "NJ", "NM", 
                 "NY", "NC", "ND", "OH", "OK", "OR", "PA", "RI", "SC", "SD", "TN", 
                 "TX", "UT", "VT", "VA", "WA", "WV", "WI", "WY", "OTHER JURISDICTIONS", "PR")
)

education_clean <- education_clean %>%
  left_join(state_codes, by = c("states" = "state_name")) %>%  # Jointure par le nom des états
  mutate(states = state_code) %>%  # Remplacer les noms par les codes
  select(-state_code)  # Supprimer la colonne temporaire

kable(
  head(education_clean, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)

```

In the following, we are going to proceed to the **cleaning of the data set about drug seizure** that we've already imported. First, we kept only 2022 as this is the only year which we will focus our analysis on, thus we removed all other years.

```{r}
#| message: false
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  filter(FY == 2022)%>%
  rename(states = `Area of Responsibility`) 
kable(
  head(drug_seizure, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

Now, the goal is to change the values in the variable `states` of the drug seizures data set because here they are organized in offices.
```{r}
# Extract unique values from the 'states' column of the drug seizures data set
offices_ds <- unique(drug_seizure$states)

# Modifying the states values with the codes of the latest
ds_offices_codes <- data.frame(
  offices = offices_ds,
  codes = c(
    "GA", "MD", "IL", "TX", "CA", "FL", "LA", "NY", "INTL", "CA", "PR", "FL", 
    "MA", "NY", "MI", "WA", "OR", "TX", "TX", "CA", "AZ", "FL", "PR", "WA", "NY", 
    "MI", "ME", "WA", "VT", "TX", "TX", "CA", "TX", "TX", "TX", "CA", "AZ", "AZ", 
    "MT", "ND", "LA"
  )
)

# Column replacement
drug_seizure <- drug_seizure %>%
  left_join(ds_offices_codes, by = c("states" = "offices")) %>%  # Joining by 'offices'
  mutate(states = ifelse(!is.na(codes), codes, states)) %>%
  select(-codes)

kable(
  head(drug_seizure, 3),
  escape = FALSE
)
```


Below is the **cleaning of the lethal overdoses data set**. First of all, we filter in order to keep only the year 2022. then, we remove the column URL, which we won't use for our analysis.
```{r}
#| message: false
lethal_overdoses <- lethal_overdoses %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2022) %>%  # Keep only data for the year 2022
  rename(states = STATE) %>%  # Rename the 'STATE' column to 'states'
  select(-URL)  # Remove the 'URL' column

kable(
  head(lethal_overdoses, 3),
  caption = "Summary of the cleaned lethal overdoses data set read as a variable: ",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

  y = Fentanyl_Seizures,
  text = paste("State:", `states`, "<br>Seizures of Fentanyl:", Fentanyl_Seizures)
